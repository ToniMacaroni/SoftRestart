# SoftRestart
**[Download Here](https://github.com/ToniMacaroni/SoftRestart/releases)**

This plugin completely skips the loading on restart by resetting the timer instead of a full reload.
It also comes with the feature to bookmark a part in the song and jumping to it at any time for practice.

Known Bugs (upon using one of the features):
- Doesn't work with Noodle Extension maps
- Counters+ will show wrong info
